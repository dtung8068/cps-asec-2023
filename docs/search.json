    "text": "1 Introduction\nHealth is undoubtedly a key dimension of our well-being. When we feel healthy, we tend to be more productive during work hours and enjoy our free time more. On the other hand, being sick is usually synonymous with feeling upset and without enough energy to pursue our goals. The words of the Roman poet Virgil come to mind: “The greatest wealth is health”. Then, it is meaningful to know the current health status of the U.S. population.\nFurthermore, it is plausible to believe that health status is not an isolated variable, but it is related with other dimensions such as race, age and economic status. Therefore, it is essential to understand how health relates to other metrics. The following questions then arise: are richer people healthier than poorer ones?, in a similar way, are employed people healthier than unemployed ones?, the level of education is positively correlated with the health status, i.e. are people with more education healthier? What is the relation with other dimensions such as race or sex? When disabled people are asked about their health status, what do they answer? Is the distribution of health status uniform across states or does it change? How is the health of native-born or naturalized US citizens related to that of non-US citizens? How does this latter relation change with age?\nWith these questions in mind, on this project we delve into the health status of people living in the United States. We analyze the distribution of health status and deepen on how it relates with other social, cultural, and economic metrics. Particularly, we are interested in understanding the relation between health and other dimensions such as age, sex, race, employment status, educational attainment, citizenship and earnings. We also study whether there are common patterns across regions in the United States.\nHaving a clear understanding of health across the country is not only important in terms of individual well-being, but also in terms of broader societal purposes. For instance, it makes sense to believe that a healthier society translates not only into more satisfied citizens, but also into a more productive workforce and, in turn, into a richer population. For both reasons, we believe that all policymakers should have a good understanding of the health status of their society.\nAs we have explained, on this project we will analyze the health status of United States society and its relations with different social, cultural, and economic dimensions. The project is structured as follows. In the ‘Data’ section we explain the data source, the selected features and the format of the dataset. In the ‘Results’ section we develop the analyses in detail, presenting the results through several graphics. In the ‘Interactive component in D3’ section we present one of our findings through an animated format using D3. Finally, in the ‘Conclusion’ section we discuss the lessons learned and we outline recommendations regarding health as public policy."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nTo analyze health status of people living in the United States and its relations with other social, cultural and economic dimensions we use the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS-ASEC from now on). This data is collected annually -mainly during March- by the U.S. Census Bureau and includes information of more than 75,000 households. It is worth noting that the dataset contains information for every member of each of the participating households.\nThe data is available on the U.S. Census Bureau’s official website in both SAS and CSV format. As it is documentated on the official Data Dictionary, the variables may refer to three different record types: Household, Family or Person. For this project, we work with a subset of the ‘Person Type’ variables. Furthermore, as we also want to use georeferencing data, we incorporate a ‘Household Type’ variable that points the state of every observation.\nThere is an available package in R called ‘cpsR’ see documentation here to import the data. Particularly, there is a function called ‘get_asec’ to load the data. However, to get the data, we first needed to request a key for the Census API through this official website. We’ll work with the most updated information so far: the 2023 CPS-ASEC dataset.\nThe 2023 CPS-ASEC dataset contains information of 146,133 individuals. Each row refers to a unique individual, identified with the variable ‘PERIDNUM’ (22-digit Unique Person identifier). Since the database is a sample, and logically does not cover the entire population, there is a variable ‘A_FNLWGT’ that contains the weight associated with each observation. It is important to take this variable into account so that the statistics and graphs are a fair representation of the overall US population.\nThere are in total 829 ‘Person Type’ variables in the dataset that cover a huge number of characteristics. For this project, since we are interested in health status and how it relates to specific social, cultural, and economic dimensions we have selected a subset of 12 ‘Person Type’ variables -additionally to the identifier and weight columns-.\nOur main variable is ‘HEA’ that refers to the health status of the person. This is a categorical variable that takes five possible values: 1 (that accounts for ‘Excellent’), 2 (‘Very good’), 3 (‘Good’), 4 (‘Fair’) or 5 (‘Poor’). We have also chosen two additional variables related to health: ‘DIS_HP’ and ‘NOW_COV’: the former indicates if the person has a health problem or a disability that prevents them from working and the latter indicates if the interviewed is currently covered by health insurance coverage. It is worth noting that ‘dis_hp’ is only available for persons aged at least 15. In addition to these 3 variables related to health, we will also work with 9 other dimensions to better understand how health relates with other metrics. These additional variables are ‘A_AGE’ (that refers to the age of the person), ‘A_SEX’ (sex), ‘PRDTRACE’ (race), ‘PEMLR’ (employment status), ‘A_HGA’ (educational attainment), ‘PRCITSHP’ (citizenship), ‘MOOP’(medical expenditure), ‘PTOTVAL’ (income) and ‘PEARNVAL’ (earnings). Finally, as we have mentioned, we include a ‘Household Type’ variable: ‘GESTFIPS’ that refers to the state in which each person is located. Regarding this point, one issue with the data is that it only covers a subset of about 1300 of the 3100 counties in the United States."

    "section": "2.2 Research Plan",
    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nThe main focus of the project is to understand the current health status of the US population. To assess it, we will analyze the variable ‘HEA’ from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey that indicates the perception of the self state of health of each interviewed individual. It is worth noting that it is not an objective metric, but rather a subjective one. We will be considering this variable as a proxy of their actual state of health.\nIn addition, we are interested not only in health status, but also in its relation to other dimensions. For instance, as we pointed out in the Introduction, we wonder whether richer people are healthier -or not- than poorer ones. To understand this relationship, we will study how variables ‘HEA’ (health status) and ‘PEARNVAL’ (earnings) and ‘PTOTVAL’ (income) interact with each other. Although we will not analyze cause-effect relationships, we will study if these dimensions are positively or negatively correlated - or maybe they are not related at all-. From an economic point of view, we should expect a positive relationship since, for example, higher earnings translate into a greater purchasing power to purchase better insurance coverage. However, there may be other factors that mediate this relation. Besides, as ‘HEA’ is a subjective measure, it could be the case that wealthier people compare their health status to the one of other wealthy people (rather than to the average population) and therefore we may not find a positive relation between economic status and health. To better understand this connection, we will also use the variables ‘DIS_HP’ and ‘NOW_COV’ that measure, respectively, if the person has a disability which prevents work, and if the person has currently health insurance coverage.\nIn a similar way, we are concerning about how employment status relates with health. It is reasonable to believe that employed people enjoy better general health. Indeed, we expect them to have more money and therefore spend more money on health treatments. Nevertheless, it could also be possible that employed people felt more stressed during the day of the interview, and their responses could underestimate their actual health status. We will deepen on this relationship analyzing the variables ‘HEA’ (health status) and ‘PEMLR’ (employment status).\nAnother research question is how the health of native-born or naturalized US citizens relates to that of non-US citizens that live in the US, and how this relation changes with age. To answer this question we will analyze the joint relationship between the variables ‘HEA’ (health status), ‘PRCITSHP’ (citizenship) and ‘A_AGE’ (age). This relationship can take different directions. For instance, it could be the case that nowadays there is no difference in health for young people between US citizens and non-US citizens. However, it is possible that some decades ago, there was a significant difference in health in terms of citizenship status -perhaps due to some health-related legislation- that persists for people who are older today. To answer this type of questions we need to analyze the three different dimensions at the same time -for example, using an adequate mosaic plot-.\nWe will also use georeferencing data of each person’s location to assess whether there are differences in health across states in the United States. In particular, we will utilize the variable ‘GESTFIPS’ that indicates the state of each observation. Finally, for all the previous analyses to be correct, we will weigh each observation with its respective weight indicated in the variable ‘A_FNLWGT’."

    "text": "2.4 Missing value analysis\nFortunately, there are no missing values for the subset of dimensions of the CPS-ASEC that we will work with.\nIndeed, we can look at this through the following graph:\n\n\nCode\nredav::plot_missing(df, percent=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have used the ‘plot_missing’ function from the ‘redav’ Package. We can see that there are no missing values on any dimension. Indeed, the only row pattern that exists in the dataset is the one that corresponds to ‘no missing values’, which is named ‘complete cases’. It is worth noting that the Census Bureau preprocesses the data and imputes missing values, before releasing the dataset. (More information about CPS ASEC preprocessing)\nAlternatively, we can draw the following graph:\n\n\nCode\nplot_missing_2 &lt;-\nfunction (data, group = list(Good = 0.05, Okay = 0.4, Poor = 0.8, \n  Scarce =  1), geom_label_args = list(), title = NULL, ggtheme = theme_gray(), \ntheme_config = list(legend.position = c(\"bottom\"))) \n{\n  pct_missing &lt;- Band &lt;- NULL\n  missing_value &lt;- data.table(profile_missing(data))\n  group &lt;- group[sort.list(unlist(group))]\n  invisible(lapply(seq_along(group), function(i) {\n    if (i == 1) {\n      missing_value[pct_missing &lt;= group[[i]], `:=`(Band,\n         names(group)[i])]\n    } else {\n  missing_value[pct_missing &gt; group[[i - 1]] & pct_missing &lt;= \n     group[[i]], `:=`(Band, names(group)[i])]\n    }\n}))\n  output &lt;- ggplot(missing_value, aes_string(x = \"feature\", \n    y = \"num_missing\", fill = \"Band\")) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n   scale_fill_manual(\"Band\", values = c(\"Good\"=\"green2\",\"Okay\"=\"gold\",\"Poor\"=\"darkorange\",\"Scarce\"=\"firebrick2\")) + coord_flip() + xlab(\"Features\") + \n   ylab(\"Missing Rows\")\n  geom_label_args_list &lt;- list(mapping = aes(label = paste0(round(100 * \n    pct_missing, 2), \"%\")))\n  output &lt;- output + do.call(\"geom_label\", c(geom_label_args_list, \n     geom_label_args)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10))\n  class(output) &lt;- c(\"single\", class(output))\n  plotDataExplorer(plot_obj = output, title = title, ggtheme = ggtheme, \n   theme_config = theme_config)\n}\n\n\nplot_missing_2(df)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create this graph we have used this adaptation from the ‘plot_missing’ function from the ‘DataExplorer’ package. Also, we have added a line of code inside the function to force the y-axis to start at 0. The graph indicates the share of rows with missing values for each of the 14 variables. It follows from the graph that there are no missing values in any of the dimensions. .\nThis characteristic of the dataset could also have been discovered through the following code:\n\n\nCode\ncolSums(is.na(df)) %&gt;% \n  sort (decreasing = TRUE)\n\n\n    ID     Wt  State     Co Health    Age    Sex   Citz   Race   Empt    Edu \n     0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0 \n  Earn    Pwd    Ins   MExp    Inc \n     0      0      0      0      0 \n\n\nAlthough there are no missing values, there are some questions that -by construction- are not asked to certain groups of people. In fact, as it can be checked on the official Data Dictionary, the dimensions ‘PEARNVAL’ and ‘DIS_HP’ are only available for people aged at least 15. It makes sense because ‘PEARNVAL’ refers to the earnings derived from wage or salary, or for self-employment income and ‘DIS_HP’ indicates whether or not the respondent has a disability that prevents them from working. Indeed, it can be checked that, for instance, the number of people with ‘DIS_HP’ == 0 that stands for “Not in Universe” equals the number of respondents up to 14 years old.\n\n\nCode\nnrow(df[df$Age &lt; 15, ]) == nrow(df[df$Pwd == 0, ])\n\n\n[1] TRUE"

For employed people, it is specially more notorious for those that has fair health (i.e., the regions shaded in orange), whereas for unemployed people it is clear for both that suffer a fair or poor health (i.e., the regions shaded in orange and red).\nRegarding the race, for both employed and unemployed people, the proportion of black people that suffers a weak state of health is greater than the proportion corresponding to white or asian people. Particularly, Asian population seems to have a quite good state of health (for unemployed ones, even better than the health of white people).\nComparing the two graphs, i.e. the population of employed and unemployed people, we see that for all races and sex, the employed people have a better health than the unemployed people which makes sense. In addition, the group of people that has the highest proportion of people with weak health (i.e., fair or poor health) is the black women without employment showing inequalities on health across U.S. people in terms of sex, race and employment status.\nIn this section we have learned that there appears to be a difference in health status depending on whether a person is currently employed or unemployed. In the next section we focus on those who are employed and study whether there is a difference on health based on earnings."

Indeed, looking at the boxplots, it follows that the both the first quartile (Q1), the median and the third quartile (Q3) of earnings increases with health status. Indeed, for instance the median of people that have an “excellent” -perceived- state of health is higher than the mean of those that have a “very good” state of health, which is in turn higher than the median corresponding to people that have a “good” state of health and so on. In other words, wealthier people enjoys a better state of health than poorer people."

Edu\",\n    TRUE ~ Edu\n  ))\n\ndf_3 &lt;- filter(df, Age&gt;=18) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Citz, Health, Edu_Grouped) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::summarize(Freq = sum(Wt))\n\ndf_3 &lt;- df_3 %&gt;%\n  group_by(Citz, Health) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Total = sum(Freq)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(df_3, aes(x = Edu_Grouped, y = Health)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = (Freq/Total)), color = \"white\") +\n  coord_fixed() + \n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"black\", mid = \"white\",\n                        high = \"green\", midpoint = .2, name = \"Share\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Citz) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0)) +\n  labs(x = \"Educational Attainment\", caption = \"Source: own elaboration for EDAV Final Project based on CPS-ASEC 2023.\\n Note: 'Adv. Edu' stands for Advanced Education and includes Bachelor degree or higher.\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Share of Educational Attainment by Health Status and Citizenship in the U.S.\")\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us analyze first the graph corresponding to Native U.S. citizens.\nWe see that for those people who enjoy an excellent or very good state of health, the square corresponding to the ‘Adv edu’ (which stands for ‘Advanced Education’, i.e., bachelor degree or higher) is filled in green color. This implies that it is quite probable for a person who enjoys a really good health status to have an advanced education degree. On the contrary, we can see that for these groups of people the squares associated with ‘H.S. Inc’ (High School Incomplete) are dark grey. This means that it is quite unlikely that the healthiest people have not completed at least high school.\nOn the other hand, if we analyze people who suffer a weak state of health (i.e., a poor or fair one) we see that the squares corresponding to advanced education are ‘not longer’ green, instead they are grey and white. This shows that for people with weak health it is quite unlikely to have an advanced level of education. On the contrary, as it can be seen on the graph, it is quite probable to ‘only’ have reached a high school degree.\nThis positive correlation between health and educational attainment can be also understood in a different way. For the columns corresponding to higher levels of education (i.e., advanced education), the colors range from darker grey colors at the top (poor health) to green colors at the bottom (excellent health), whereas something opposite occurs for more basic levels of education.\nSomething similar happens to the other citizenship categories such as “Naturalized” or “Not U.S. Citizen”. It is particularly interesting to note that for those non U.S. citizens that suffer a weak state of health (i.e., poor or fair) it is quite likely to have a poor level of education since the corresponding squares are green.\n\n\n3.5.2 Analysis by Race\n\n\nCode\ndf_4 &lt;- filter(df, Age&gt;=18 & (Race == \"White\" | Race == \"Black\" | Race == \"Asian\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Race, Health, Edu_Grouped) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::summarize(Freq = sum(Wt))\n\ndf_4 &lt;- df_4 %&gt;%\n  group_by(Race, Health) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Total = sum(Freq)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(df_4, aes(x = Edu_Grouped, y = Health)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = (Freq/Total)), color = \"white\") +\n  coord_fixed() + \n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"black\", mid = \"white\",\n                        high = \"green\", midpoint = .2, name = \"Share\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Race) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0)) +\n  labs(x = \"Educational Attainment\", caption = \"Source: own elaboration for EDAV Final Project based on CPS-ASEC 2023.\\n Note: 'Adv. Edu' stands for Advanced Education and includes Bachelor degree or higher.\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Share of Educational Attainment by Health Status and Race in the U.S.\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we split the population by race instead of citizenship, we continue observing an positive correlation between health and education.\nFor instance, we see that for those people who enjoy a really good state of health, the square corresponding to advanced education is filled in green color (especially for white and asian people). This implies that it is quite probable for a person who enjoys a really good health status to have an advanced education degree. On the contrary, we can see that for these groups of people the squares associated with a low education level are dark grey. This means that it is quite unlikely that the healthiest people have not completed at least high school."

    "text": "3.6 Expenditure on Health\nOn the following graph we study how the expenditure on health changes across the different health status and over income.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(3267)\nsamp_idx &lt;- sample(seq_len(nrow(df)), size=400, prob=df$Wt)\nnew_data &lt;- df[samp_idx, ]\n\np &lt;- ggplot(new_data, aes(x = Inc, y = MExp, label = State)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Ins), size = 0.8, alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Yes\" = \"green\", \"No\" = \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~Health, scales = \"free\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-3)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-3)) +\n  labs(x = \"Income (in thousands)\",y = \"Expenditure on health (in thousands)\", caption = \"Source: own elaboration for EDAV Final Project based on CPS-ASEC 2023.\") + \n  labs(color = \"Insurance\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Expenditure on Health\") + \n  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\np_plotly &lt;- plotly::ggplotly(p)\n\np_plotly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have chosen a sample of 400 individuals, taking into account the weight of each observation in the entire population. Therefore, as we have explained with the first graph of this section and can be seen in this new graph, the number of people in the sample with very good health is the highest and the number of people with poor health is the smallest.\nThe graph shows that there seems to be a positive correlation between the income and the expenditure on health, which makes sense. Indeed, for every state of health, the points appear to increase in both directions, that is, the higher the income, the higher the health expenditure.\nAlso, we see that people who enjoy a better state of health tend to be richer and also to spend more money on health, which can be explained if they acquire for example better insurance. It can be noted from the graph looking at the scale of both axis for the different facets. For instance, we can see that there are a bunch of people who enjoy an excellent or very good state of health that have an income greater than 100 thousand dollars, however this is something really unlikely for people who suffer a weak state of health. Something similar happens in terms of the expenditure on health.\nRegarding the insurance coverage, we see that most people in the U.S. have insurance coverage, regardless of their health status."

    "text": "Use the slider to adjust the x-axis. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 2 in intervals of 0.1, representing annual earnings in millions of dollars. We already know from Section 3.5 that all the earnings are right-skewed and Q1, median, and Q3 are all positively correlated with health status. Adjusting the slider allows us to see how exactly these values differ. More specifically, we can see that median income varies between 0.03 million and 0.05 million ($30k - 50k) while upper quantile income varies between 0.055 million and 0.09 million ($55k - 90k). Lower quantile is quite interesting because we can see that people with Excellent and Very Good health have identical lower quantiles (roughly $30k income). On top of indicating that the positive correlation is not as strong as previously suggested, it also indicates that 75% more people with Excellent or Very Good health make at least $30k annually compared to just 50% of people with Poor health."
